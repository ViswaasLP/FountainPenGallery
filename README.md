## Unit Testing Methods

In order to make sure the website adheres to WCAG AA standards, a testing methodology is established. They cover the various scenarios a website would be accessed.

### Keyboard user scenario

The user would use only the keyboard to navigate through the site. Tab orders and visual focus indicators would be tested. Functionality of componnents as well.

### Screen reader scenario

The user would use the JAWS screen reader and will navigate through the site with the keyboard. The states, roles and accessible names would be tested.

### AMP Manual Testing

A thorough testing procedure containing multiple guidelines that the website should adhere to. These guidelines directly reference from the WCAG AA guidelines. The tool used for the baseline testing is [Access Assistant](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/access-assistant/ojiighldhdmahfdnhfdebnpmlbiemdfm?hl=en-US).
